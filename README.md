# bee-movie-script-spam
Have you ever wanted to spam a group chat with Bee movie script word by word? Now you can

This code requires really basic knowledge with Python and 'keyboard' library and Python

To install "Keyboard" Library, type [pip install keyboard] 

Put the 'Bee.txt' and 'Script.py' in the same directory and run Script.py in a command prompt in the same directory or else you'll get errors

The code has a 3 second delay for you to click on message box of your preffered messaging app before it starts and has a 0.3 seconds delay between each word sent, both of the delays can be modified in the code itself if needed. This code emulates a keyboard which means you can use this code in any app that supports key input.

The script might get out of hand and to stop the script you can click on the command prompt where the code is running and hit [Ctrl+C] which will terminate the code. But if you modified the delay a little to much (like I did) its basically impossible to recover without a hard restart.

Delay Value Tested:

[0.5, 0.3] : Useable and managable, Discord will spit out spam warnings though

[0.1] : Still kinda managable but its starting to get out of hand

[0.01] : Goodluck with that

[0] : ...............
